# Hospital Frontdesk

This project is simple demo application to integrate rails api and react js
together.

Backend is powered by rails api `rails new <appname> --api` and Front end is
powered by `create-react-app` CLI. We are keeping both rails api and react
application together. You can find react application inside `client` directory.
